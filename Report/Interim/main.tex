\begin{abstract}
This interim report discusses the progress and plans of work towards a project about speech recognition for embedded systems.  The overall goals of this project are outlined, and background information on various aspects of the project is given, along with details from various knowledge sources.  The technical progress that that has been made is discussed, followed by plans for the remaining work.

\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
Speech recognition is an interesting computational problem, for which there is no fool-proof solution at this time.  Recently the industry for embedded devices and small-scale digital systems has expanded greatly, but in general these devices do not have the power or speed to run speech recognition.  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) may present a way of increasing the capability of such systems, as they are able to perform calculations much faster than traditional microprocessors.
